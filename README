This repository Builds one application with three threads

MODBUS-BACnet Bridge
	This Application connects to a ModBus server and the reads 
	the registers and adds them to the tail of a linked list.
	At the same time it connects to a BACnet client where it reads 
	the client reques, and if the request matches the device ID and
	the instance number then it will remove the ModBus data from the
	head of the linked list and reply to the client with the data.
